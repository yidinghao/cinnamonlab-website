<p><strong>What does “cinnamonlab” mean?</strong><br />
It stands for “cinnamonlab is not <a href="https://najoung.kim/">Najoung’s</a>, <a href="https://aaronmueller.github.io/">Aaron Mueller’s</a>, or <a href="https://nsaphra.net/">Naomi’s</a> lab.”</p>

<p><strong>What does the logo mean?</strong><br />
I asked Google Gemini to draw me a picture of a cinnamon lab, and this is what it came up with. This is a picture of a cinnamon labrador retriever (a type of dog, apparently), which is what you get if you Google <em>cinnamon lab</em>. However, I was not able to find any evidence that the term “cinnamon labrador” is actually used by dog experts. Instead, it seems that this type of dog is usually known as a “chocolate labrador.”</p>
