# Welcome

Cinnamonlab is a computational linguistics research group at Boston University led by [Sophie Hao](https://www.notaphonologist.com). Cinnamonlab takes an interdisciplinary approach to language model interpretability and its applications, incorporating ideas and perspectives from across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Research areas include:
- probing, neural representations, feature attribution
- linguistic evaluation and psycholinguistic modeling
- theory of computation, analysis of neural architectures
- generative linguistics, syntax, phonology, mathematical linguistics
- bias, fairness, digital humanities and social science
- theoretical foundations of NLP and computational linguistics.

Cinnamonlab is affiliated with the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.bu.edu/linguistics/) and the SALAMI Consortium.
