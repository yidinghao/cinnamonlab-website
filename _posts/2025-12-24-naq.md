These are questions about cinnamonlab that no one has asked me (yet), but I imagine someone will one day.

**What does "cinnamonlab" mean?**<br />
It stands for "cinnamonlab is not [Najoung's](https://najoung.kim/), [Aaron Mueller's](https://aaronmueller.github.io/), or [Naomi's](https://nsaphra.net/) lab." 

**What does the logo mean?**<br />
I asked Google Gemini to draw me a picture of a cinnamon lab, and this is what it came up with. This is a picture of a cinnamon labrador retriever (a type of dog, apparently), which is what you get if you Google _cinnamon lab_. However, I was not able to find any evidence that the term "cinnamon labrador" is actually used by dog experts. Instead, it seems that this type of dog is usually known as a "chocolate labrador."

**How do you spell "cinnamonlab"?**<br />
Either ⟨Cinnamonlab⟩ or ⟨cinnamonlab⟩. It's all one word, and it may be [capitalized](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Capitalization.html) either like a proper noun or like a common noun. 

**What are the grammatical features of _cinnamonlab_?**<br />
_Cinnamonlab_ is one lexical item, pronounced /ˈsɪnəmɨnˌlæ:b/. Regardless of how you choose to capitalize it, _cinnamonlab_ is a proper noun in the sense that it is a determiner with no complements, whose semantic type is _e_. _Cinnamonlab_ has the same morphological structure as _New York City_ or _JetBlue Airways_.

**Does cinnamonlab have any relation to [Cinnamon Lab](http://cinnamon-lab.com/) or [Cinnamon Labs](https://www.cinnamonlabs.cc/)?**<br />
No.
